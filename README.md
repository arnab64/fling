# fling: fastBoard Lingusitics
### Deploy real-time unsupervised linguistic functionalities to your applications. 

This repository is a lightweight library for performing unsupervised text processing tasks, and using real-time unsupervised learning and inference functionalities in your application for better runtime inference. The lingusitic features can be used for a multitude of uses including search, adverstising, personalization and recommendation. 

## Version 0.1 Beta:
- add DBSCAN clusters using tfidf as a new label to your data.
- add fasttext based supervised and unsupervised word vector as label.
- add DBSCAN clusters using fasttext word vectors.
- save cluster characteristics train on one set of data to cluster files on a different task.
- compute clusters on runtime on a data pool, and assign labels based on previously trained cluster characteristic file 

## API Version 0.1 Beta:
- real-time unsupervised linguistic inference tasks for applications

## Pretrained packages
- search optimization linguistic packages for multiple domains (e-commerce, real-estate, social-networks)
- ads optimization packages
- user-level recommendation packages for 


## Version 1.0 (Feb 2021)
- Train your own custom characteristic files for real-time linguistic inference.
- Deploy using a single command, using our Kubernetes-based fast deploy system.
- Deploy an online learning algorithm on your own traffic.
- User our AI traffic simulators for a better analytics on your site, without having to wait a month on live traffic.

# fling: fastBoard Lingusitics
### Deploy real-time unsupervised linguistic functionalities to your applications. 

This repository is a lightweight library for performing unsupervised text processing tasks, and using real-time unsupervised learning and inference functionalities in your application for better runtime inference.  

## Version 0.1 Beta:
- add DBSCAN clusters using tfidf as a new label to your data.
- add fasttext based supervised and unsupervised word vector as label.
- add DBSCAN clusters using fasttext word vectors.
- save cluster characteristics train on one set of data to cluster files on a different task.
- compute clusters on runtime on a data pool, and assign labels based on previously trained cluster characteristic file 

## API Version 0.1 Beta:
- real-time unsupervised linguistic inference tasks for applications
